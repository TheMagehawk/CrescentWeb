Crescent is a general-purpose Engine made with flexibility, configurability, efficiency and portability in mind. Originally I, Magehawk, wanted to just work on a more ambitious Programming Project to work on my skillsets and gain experience and proficiency. It turned out to become a huge part of my development process and now I strive to create a community around my projects and share my thoughts on it. Hopefully, I can help other people with their programming journey or help them develop cool Games :)
